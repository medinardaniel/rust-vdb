Interinstitutional Registration
Under the interinstitutional registration agreement, any graduate, professional or undergraduate student enrolled as a degree seeking student at any of the following universities may participate in registration via the interinstitutional registration process:
- Duke University
- North Carolina Central University
- North Carolina State University
- University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
- University of North Carolina at Charlotte
- University of North Carolina at Greensboro
The student may take a course at a participating university if the student's academic advisor and/or dean can certify that the course is appropriate for the student's degree program and that the course is not available during the same academic term at the home institution. Registration deadlines of the home institution should be observed.
Students may not audit courses under the interinstitutional registration agreement.
Maximum Number of Courses Allowed
Graduate and Professional School Students: Two courses per term (fall and spring semesters), provided that the student is also registered for the balance of their normal load at the home institution.
Undergraduate Students: One course per term (fall and spring semesters), provided that the student is also registered for the balance of their normal load at the home institution.
All Students: One course per summer session (or term), provided that the student is concurrently registered for one course with an equivalent credit value at the home institution.
Academic calendars and procedures at the six institutions vary. It is very important that students plan carefully and apply early to minimize problems in the registration process. The interinstitutional registration agreement requires students to apply and register for courses only through their home institution.
All foreign national students (undergraduate, graduate and professional) must present evidence of immigration status to Duke Visa Services before the first day of classes. Failure to comply will result in the inability to enroll for classes. Duke Visa Services will block enrollment for any students who fail to comply with this policy. Learn more by visiting Duke Visa Services or calling (919) 681-8472.

Students visiting from other campuses
Students wishing to register for a Duke University course through the Interinstitutional Registration Program should contact the registrar's office of their home institution for instructions regarding initial registration procedures.
Visiting interinstitutional students cannot participate in the online registration process at Duke.
Students should submit an Interinstitutional Approval Form to their home institution giving ample time for review/action prior to the beginning of classes at Duke. Priority for registration for all Duke University courses is given to Duke students. Interinstitutional students are assigned to available class seats beginning on the first day of drop/add. Interinstitutional students are not included on wait lists.
Visiting students should review the Duke University Academic Calendar before requesting enrollment. Students graduating concurrently with interinstitutional enrollment should pay particular attention to the Duke University Exam Schedule.
GENERAL POLICIES FOR STUDENTS VISITING DUKE
Registration Deadlines
Visiting students should observe and follow the registration deadlines, including drop/add, of their home institution.
Permission Required
Pay close attention when looking up a course, to the "Enrollment Information" in the "Class Detail" to determine if instructor consent is required to enroll. To register for a course that requires instructor consent, students must obtain a permission number from the instructor. The permission number must be listed on the Interinstitutional Approval Form when it is submitted to the Office of the University Registrar. Verbal permission is not acceptable. During the last week of the Drop/Add period, a permission number is required to register for all Law, Nursing and undergraduate courses.
Confirmation of Enrollment
Confirmation of class enrollment will be sent to the email address on the Interinstitutional Approval Form. The notification will include all pertinent information relating to registration and auxiliary services.
Access to DukeHub/Sakai
Within 48 hours after you receive your confirmation of enrollment, students will receive an email from the Office of Information Technology (OIT) that will include a link for a student to receive a NetID and password which will enable the student to access DukeHub and Sakai. If enrollment is completed after classes have started, students will not have access to DukeHub and Sakai. Course materials (syllabi, homework assignments, etc.) are available only in DukeHub and Sakai.
Tuition
Charges for courses taken at Duke will be billed to the student's account at the home institution according to the rates at the home institution. There may be special fees associated with a particular course and should be paid at Duke University. All extemporaneous fees accrued while at Duke University are the responsibility of the student and should be paid to the Duke Bursar's office. The student should regularly monitor their Duke assigned email account for any possible fee statements issued to them. Failure to do so could result in late payment fees or collections. Any questions should be referred to the Duke Bursar's office directly at (919) 684-3531. Click here for more about the Duke Bursar office billing schedule.
Grades
Grades will be reported at the end of the term to the Registrar's Office of the visiting student's home institution. Grades will be in accordance with the Duke University grading system and will be converted into the home institution's grading system by the home institution before being added to the student's record.
Library Usage
Visiting students must present a current student ID with an active expiration date from their home institution when checking out material from the Perkins Library. More information concerning library usage is available from the Duke University Perkins Library Circulation Desk at (919) 660-5870.
Parking and Transportation
Visit Duke Transportation to find available parking at Duke, and information on transportation between Duke and other universities.

Registration Procedures
All of the following steps must be completed in order to be properly registered and to receive a grade. Registration must be completed at both Duke University and the visited institution. No enrollment is considered to be completed until enrollment confirmation is received by the student.
Complete the Interinstitutional Approval Form (linked above). Approval forms may also be obtained at the Office of the University Registrar and in most of the offices of the Deans, Directors of Graduate and Undergraduate Studies. Be sure to list complete course information, using subject abbreviation and course number, on the form. The class number is not required. No other registration process is necessary at the visited school.
Approval Signatures. Approval signatures may vary by school
Divinity School - Dean's signature only (Daniel Castelo or Deborah Hackney)
Fuqua - School signature only (Pamela White or Sharon Campen)
Graduate School - Departmental and dean’s signature (DGS/Advisor and Helene McAdams)
Law School - Dean’s signature only (Tia Barnes or Amanda Lacoff)
Nicholas School of the Environment - School signature only (Erika Lovelace)
Sanford School of Public Policy - School signature only (Anita Lyon)
Undergraduates - Departmental and dean’s signature. Both the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) for the subject being taken and the student's Academic Dean will need to approve the undergraduate student's Interinstitutional registration. The DUS approval should be obtained before requesting the Dean's approval.
Check Course Footnotes - To determine if permission is required to register for a course, check the Schedule of Courses to see if a footnote indicating as such is listed for the course. Permissions will vary according to schools.
Instructor's Permission. With the exception of NCCU, if the course bears a footnote which indicates that permission of the instructor is required to register, the student may make arrangements to have the instructor's permission forwarded to the Registrar's Office of the visited institution (written or by e-mail, no telephone calls accepted), or obtain instructor's signature on the Interinstitutional approval form. Instructor's permission to register at NCCU should accompany the approval form.
Special Note to Graduate Students. Enrollment only in continuation credit does not meet the requirement to be registered for the balance of a normal load at Duke. The credit unit for continuation does not count in the cumulative credits needed to meet the balance of a normal load requirement.
Form Submission. Once the Interinstitutional Approval Form has been completed and all required approval signatures obtained, submit the form by fax, email, or in person to the Office of the University Registrar.
Confirmation of Enrollment. Confirmation of class enrollment will be sent to the email address on the Interinstitutional Approval Form. Response time varies per university. Questions concerning registration and auxiliary services should be directed to the visited institution.

Online/Distance Education Courses
Students may not enroll in online/distance education courses under the interinstitutional registration agreement.

Tuition
Billing will be done for Interinstitutional registration at Duke's rates. If there is a special fee associated with a particular course, the fee should be paid at the visited school. All other extemporaneous fees accrued while at the visited institution including, but not limited to parking, library, and ID cards, are the responsibility of the student and should also be paid at the visited school.  Failure to do so could result in late payment fees and collections. The student should regularly monitor their assigned email account at the visited school for any possible fee statements they may be issued. Any questions should be referred to the visited institution's Bursar's office directly.

Grades
At the end of the term, the Registrar's Office of the visited school will report grades to Duke. Grades will be in accordance with the visited school's grading system and will be converted into Duke's grading system before being added to the student's record. Interinstitutional courses may not be taken on a pass/fail or audit basis.

Drop/Add Procedures
The Duke University drop/add deadlines should always be observed when requesting to drop or add an Interinstitutional course.
To drop an Interinstitutional course notify the Office of the University Registrar prior to the end of the drop/add deadline. The class will be dropped from your record, and the visited school will be notified to do the same.
To add an additional Interinstitutional course or to change from one course to another, the initial procedures must be repeated and must be done during the Duke University drop/add period.

Late Registration
UNC-CH and NCSU
To add a course after the visited institution's drop/add deadline, instructor's permission is required and should be either presented with the approval form or forwarded to the visited institution's Registrar's Office.
NCCU
Registration after the last day to add a course requires written permission from the instructor and should be submitted with the approval form.

Library Usage
Students should contact the circulation desk at the library of the visited school to obtain information on the use of the library.

Permission numbers are crucial in the registration process for various reasons, including allowing students to enroll when they don't meet prerequisites, to override class capacities, or when classes require permission. Notably, during the second week of classes, permission numbers are required for all undergraduate courses below the 500 level.
**Important Notes:**
- Students must obtain permission numbers from the course instructor or the department.
- Permission numbers are specific to each class section and are not transferable between cross-listed sections.

Robertson Scholars
The Robertson Scholars program was created and funded by UNC alumnus Julian Robertson and his wife, Josie. Each year, the Robertson Scholars Program selects thirty new scholars—half matriculate at Duke University and half at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. All exhibit academic excellence, leadership potential, a commitment to community service, and behavior that is grounded in strong ethical principles. Every Robertson Scholar has two dynamic intellectual homes at two superb universities—Duke and UNC-Chapel Hill.
All Robertson Scholars are required to take a minimum of five courses at the sister campus during their undergraduate experience. This number can include the Robertson Colloquium (taken spring of the first year) and the Senior Capstone (taken spring of the senior year). Unlike other students at Duke and UNC-Chapel Hill who are limited to one interinstitutional course per semester and can take only courses that are not available on their home campus, Robertson Scholars may take more than one class per semester on the sister campus, including those that are available at their home institution. Scholars are encouraged to take advantage of the course offerings at both schools as much as possible. However, students must remember that major, minor, or certificate programs require a percentage of courses to be completed on the home campus and students must obtain the appropriate approvals for every course taken at the sister school.
